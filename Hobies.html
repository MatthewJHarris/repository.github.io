<center>Fishing and bird hunting have always been a large part of my life, but fly fishing has brought me to some amazing places. Pictured above is me in the US Virgin islands fishing on the flats for Bonefish. During this trip I had the opportunity to go after many different types of reef fish, Bonefish, and Tarpon. I currently am in the works of planning trips to Iceland, Alaska, and Colorado.
On top of fishing and hunting, In Addition to fly fishing, I enjoy hiking, canoeing, rock climbing, and many other things.  </center>
